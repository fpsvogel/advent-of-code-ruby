# Slowly solving past Advent of Code puzzles in Ruby

See extended commit messages for TILs, or follow me on [Mastodon](https://ruby.social/@fpsvogel) or [Bluesky](https://fpsvogel.bsky.social) where I post about them.

## Why Advent of Code?

Because lots of people have posted their solutions, which I can learn from. [I created a Ruby gem](https://github.com/fpsvogel/advent_of_ruby) that shows these solutions, and more generally removes the busywork so that doing Advent of Code is a streamlined experience where I don't have to leave my editor.

## Why Ruby?

Because it's a fun little language, especially for writing small programs.

[Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org) also looks fun, but I'm waiting until it's more stable.
